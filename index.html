      <b>Our mission</b>
      <br>
      Throughout the school years of one’s life, it’s common to 
      encounter different problems that may seem daunting to solve, 
      especially if they relate to your mental health. This problem is 
      prevalent in teenagers, as many find it difficult to reach out 
      and speak to others when it comes to emotional problems. 
      Because of this, Hybridized Help Online aims to connect those in 
      need to official resources as well as be an empathetic chatbot 
      catered to specific personality types’ conversational styles.
